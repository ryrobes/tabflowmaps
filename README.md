# Tableau Flow Maps

A simple visualizer for your Tableau dashboard actions relationships and how they impact the data flow.

Tableau's dashboard "action" system, when combined with parameters, calculated fields, and filter inputs allows for some very complex interactions to be orchestrated. The problem is that Tableau really doesn't give you a very good way to holistically look at all those UX relationships and how they interact together.

Enter Flow Maps - a simple viewer that attempts to fill this gap - even if only for a knowledge transfer / documentation sake.

## Flow Maps is trying to answer these kind of questions:

### When a user interacts with a (source) Worksheet
- What fields are involved?
- What other worksheets does this target
- What action (or actions) is responsible?

### When a user triggers a Set Parameter action
- What are the downstream worksheets affected by this (since they use the param in question - directly or indirectly)

### When a user interacts with a workbook filter widget
- What worksheets are involved due to shared filters (global, ds-based, selective, etc)

### And more abstractly: Do any of these interactions clash?
